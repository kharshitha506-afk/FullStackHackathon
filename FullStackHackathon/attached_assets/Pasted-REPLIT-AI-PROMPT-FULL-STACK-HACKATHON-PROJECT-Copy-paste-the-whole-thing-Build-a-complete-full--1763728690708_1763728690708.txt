REPLIT AI PROMPT (FULL-STACK HACKATHON PROJECT)

Copy–paste the whole thing:

Build a complete full-stack project named “PhishShield – Hybrid Phishing & Scam Detection System”.
Create both the frontend and backend with full integration.
Use HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend and Python Flask for the backend.
Include a simple ML model (Logistic Regression + TF-IDF) for phishing text classification.
Use a rule-based engine + psychology trigger detector.
Make everything run inside Replit.

🎯 PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
1. Pages to Create

Create a clean frontend with these pages:

Home Page

Project intro

Buttons: Scan Message, Scan URL, About

Scan Message Page

Textarea input

Button to analyze message

Display results:

Rule-based output

ML prediction (phishing or safe)

Psychology triggers

Final verdict (badge)

Scan URL Page

URL input

Button to scan

Display results:

URL safety checks

ML score

Final phishing verdict

About Page

Team

Tech stack

Hackathon purpose

🎨 Frontend Requirements

Use:

HTML

CSS

JavaScript

Bootstrap (optional)

Create folder structure:

/frontend
   index.html
   scan-message.html
   scan-url.html
   about.html
   /assets
       style.css
       script.js


Frontend uses fetch() to call backend:

fetch("http://localhost:5000/analyze_message")
fetch("http://localhost:5000/scan_url")

🧠 Backend Requirements (Flask)

Create:

/backend
   app.py
   rules.py
   utils.py
   model.pkl
   vectorizer.pkl
   requirements.txt


Backend must include:

/analyze_message POST endpoint

/scan_url POST endpoint

Rule-based detection

Psychology trigger detection (urgency, fear, authority, reward)

ML model with TF-IDF + Logistic Regression

Return results as JSON

Enable CORS so frontend works.

🔗 FULL INTEGRATION

Make sure:

Frontend calls backend via fetch

JSON results are parsed and shown in UI

Both run correctly on Replit

🚀 Setup & Run Instructions

At the end, generate steps:

How to install dependencies

How to train the model

How to run Flask

How to preview frontend

How to deploy the backend

📦 OUTPUT FORMAT

Provide:

Full code for all files

Folder structure

Integration code

Instructions

API documentation

Make sure everything is clean, readable, and hackathon-friendly.
